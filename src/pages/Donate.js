                        Contributions to GoBridge via BridgeFoundry allow
                        thousands of volunteers across the world to teach
                        workshops and provide resource to women and others who
                        are underserved in access to technology and tech skills.
                        Most workshops happen without needing any funds with
                        companies providing space and food for our events.
                        Providing food is an equalizer, making it so people who
                        canâ€™t afford to go out for lunch are not separated from
                        those that can. Meals also provide a comfortable space
                        for informal networking. Your donation is fully
                        tax-deductible. See About BridgeFoundry for more
                        non-profit details, including their EIN. When donating
                        through BridgeFoundry please note the funds are for
                        GoBridge. <br />{" "}
